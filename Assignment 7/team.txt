Name: Nathan Ng

Name(s) of teammates: Jason Tsai, Alina Daraphet

Contributions of each team member: 

We all went through the code together, bounced ideas off each other, and looked over each others code. So everyone equally contributed to the project (we all worked on our own code on our own computers).

What made this team successful or unsuccessful (tools/apps, communication, etc.)? 

Working in the library was helpful because we didn't have to use any tools to communicate with each other. Also we worked very efficiently and I think this team was successful because some of us had trouble on certain parts, so being able to ask others who understood certain parts of the project better was very helpful. Overall, I think this was a very good and successful experience.
